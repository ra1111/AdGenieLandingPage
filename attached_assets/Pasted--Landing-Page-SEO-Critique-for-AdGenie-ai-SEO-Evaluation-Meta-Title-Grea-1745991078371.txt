**Landing Page & SEO Critique for AdGenie.ai**

---

### 🔍 SEO Evaluation

**Meta Title:**
- ✅ Great use of keywords: "AdGenie AI: Create Scroll-Stopping Ads for Shopify | Facebook, Instagram, Google"
- ❌ Slightly long. Ideal is under 60 characters. Suggest trimming to:
  > "AdGenie AI – Shopify Ad Generator for Facebook & Instagram"

**Meta Description:**
- ✅ Strong call-to-action and keyword density.
- Could slightly shorten or reword to improve CTR:
  > "Create image and text ads for Shopify in seconds. Works with Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Pinterest."

**H1 Tag:**
- ✅ Present and strong: "Create Scroll-Stopping Ads in Seconds"
- Suggest: Add "for Shopify" to anchor keyword.

**Alt Text on Images:**
- One alt tag seen is present and well-written:
  > `alt="AdGenie AI interface demo showing ad creation process"`
- Recommendation: Make sure *every* image includes keyword-anchored alt text, e.g.:
  > `alt="Shopify ad generation app UI screenshot"`

**URL Structure:**
- Replit-hosted URL is temporary and not SEO-friendly. Move to `advgenie.com`.
- Use paths like `/features`, `/pricing`, `/blog/how-to-create-facebook-ads-shopify`

**Heading Structure:**
- H1 to H3 hierarchy is well used.
- Add more internal links between sections (e.g., pricing -> install)

**Mobile Optimization:**
- ✅ Clean, fast, responsive.

**Page Speed:**
- Appears smooth on scroll, good transitions.
- Later, consider image compression + lazy loading.
